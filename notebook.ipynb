Recently, one of those changed hands for over one million dollars, which shows how lucrative the job can be.</p>\n<p>But this is the age of business intelligence and analytics! Even taxi drivers can stand to benefit from some careful investigation of the data, guiding them to maximize their profits. In this project, we will analyze a random sample of 49999 New York journeys made in 2013. We will also use regression trees and random forests to build a model that can predict the locations and times when the biggest fares can be earned.</p>\n<p>Let's start by taking a look at the

Where  do people spend the most?\n<p>So it looks like the random forest model captured some of the patterns in our data. At this point in the analysis, there are many more things we could do that we haven't done. We could add more predictors if we have the data. We could try to fine-tune the parameters of <code>randomForest</code>. And we should definitely test the model on a hold-out test dataset.
